Pure_Water_Diplo.py
added/changed 2 marks to check for:

Diviner marks
added "Born under the" to check for zodiac reveal mark. This will return any of the variable marks with that string. Born under the [variable], revealed by [variable]
Geomancer marks
changed 'Tiaoli Follower, Chosen by' to 'Tiaoli' this will return any of the variable marks with that string.
fixed spelling of 'Tiaoli'
commented out a manual check of honor position

fixed counter

added InputCleaner.py to remove spaces from input on "!eval  raymon"
- this needs to be called in main.py to clean input before the input goes into something else
like !add    karma would reject right now - but remove all spaces and rejoin to a string will make it !add karma!

1/21/23 
Added cleanString to InputCleaner.py - cleanString accepts input of string, splits, removes spaces, and returns a complete string with no extra spaces.
added this method call to main.py to clean input before it is evaluated by the first logic

3/30/23 - Soulhunter Update
Changed method call from getShield(name) to getHonor(name) - honorable position check was checking for shield credit and using the shield credit data to report as if it were an honorable position.

4/4/23 - Diplomacy update
changed list structure of marks in Pure_Water_Diplo.py to increase readability to accomidate verification of spelling and mark count request.
